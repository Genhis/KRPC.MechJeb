.. class:: OperationResonantOrbit

   Resonant orbit is useful for placing satellites to a constellation. This mode should be used starting from a orbit in the desired orbital plane. Important parameter to this mode is the desired orbital ratio, which is the ratio between period of your current orbit and the new orbit.
   To deploy satellites, set the denominator to number of satellites you want to have in the constellation. Setting the nominator to one less than denominator is the most efficient, but not necessary the fastest. To successfully deploy all satellites, make sure the numbers are incommensurable.

   .. method:: make_node()

      Execute the operation and create appropriate maneuver nodes.
      A warning may be stored in ErrorMessage during this process; so it may be useful to check its value.

      OperationException is thrown when there is something wrong with the operation.
      MJServiceException - Internal service error.

OperationTransfer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. class:: OperationTransfer

   Bi-impulsive (Hohmann) transfer to target.

   This option is used to plan transfer to target in single sphere of influence. It is suitable for rendezvous with other vessels or moons.
   Contrary to the name, the transfer is often uni-impulsive. You can select when you want the manevuer to happen or select optimum time.
