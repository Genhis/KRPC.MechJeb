Installation
============

1. Install `kRPC <https://krpc.github.io/krpc/getting-started.html>`_ and `MechJeb 2 <https://www.curseforge.com/kerbal/ksp-mods/mechjeb>`_ mods.
2. Download `latest release files <https://github.com/Genhis/KRPC.MechJeb/releases>`_.
3. Copy KRPC.MechJeb.dll to ``Kerbal Space Program/GameData/kRPC`` directory.
4. If you are using Python, Lua or similar client libraries, you can start coding right away. For C-nano, C++, C# and Java, find the relevant file in the release archive and link it with your project.
5. Happy coding!

If you encounter any issues, please check if your kRPC and MechJeb 2 versions are supported for your chosen kRPC.MechJeb version. Newer versions may contain breaking changes, so it may be necessary to downgrade them to the latest supported versions. A popup will notify you about potential issues when you start the game, listing functions/properties which are unavailable. If you don't see the popup, kRPC.MechJeb should work as expected.
