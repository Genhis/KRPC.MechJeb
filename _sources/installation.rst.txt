.. _installation:

Installation
============

1. Install `kRPC <https://krpc.github.io/krpc/getting-started.html>`_ and `MechJeb 2 <https://www.curseforge.com/kerbal/ksp-mods/mechjeb>`_ mods.
2. Download `latest release files <https://github.com/Genhis/KRPC.MechJeb/releases>`_.
3. Copy KRPC.MechJeb.dll to ``Kerbal Space Program/GameData/kRPC`` directory.
4. If you are using Python, Lua or similar client libraries, you can start coding right away. For C-nano, C++, C# and Java, find the relevant file in the release archive and link it with your project.
5. Happy coding!

Although all examples have been tested using **kRPC v0.4.8** and **MechJeb v2.8.3.0**, I do support upcoming versions, so please create a new issue if something doesn't work for you.
