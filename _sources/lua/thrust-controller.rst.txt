      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: flameout_safety_pct: number

      The jet safety margin. A value between 0 and 1.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: boolean

   .. attribute:: manage_intakes: boolean



      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: boolean

   .. attribute:: max_acceleration: number

      Limit acceleration to [m/s^2] (never exceed the acceleration during ascent).

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: max_dynamic_pressure: number

      Limit the maximal dynamic pressure in Pa.
      This avoids that pieces break off during launch because of atmospheric pressure.

      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: max_throttle: number

      Never exceed the percentage of the throttle during ascent (value between 0 and 1).

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: min_throttle: number

      Never go below the percentage of the throttle during ascent (value between 0 and 1).
